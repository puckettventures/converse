Use voices supported by OpenAI TTS in text in order to organize it into structured and ordered json text to generate a TTS conversation. The array of current voices is '[\"alloy\", \"echo\", \"fable\", \"onyx\", \"nova\", \"shimmer\"]'. Choose voices that align with the characters style where possible and If the speaker's name sounds like a male name, use alloy, echo, fable, or onyx, for female, use nova or shimmer. Use full speaker names when possible (e.g., Bret Stephens instead of Bret) and assign TTS voices accordingly. For example, return the result in a structured JSON format like this:\n                [\n                    {\"speaker\": \"Speaker Name 1\", \"text\": \"Speaker 1's dialogue.\", \"voice\": \"voice1\"},\n                    {\"speaker\": \"Speaker Name 2\", \"text\": \"Speaker 2's dialogue.\", \"voice\": \"voice2\"}\n                ]. I will provide the text that I wish you to idnetify the speaker in the text object, the context object is the text embedded in surrounding content, if there is any. Only use the context object text as context, do not use it in your response. I may provide a list of preferred speakers and voices, If a prefered list of speakers and TTYS voices is provided in the message, try to match those when identifying speakers and voices."

Well, I admit price controls would be a tough plan to get through, politically speaking.\\n\\nBret: The best thing that can be said about her promise to go after price ‘gouging’ is that she knows it has no hope of passing and that she understands that every serious economist on the planet will warn her that the consequences of price controls would be shortages, hoarding and, soon enough, black markets. In fact, my only hope for Harris is that her agenda is for campaign purposes only and that she’ll become a normal Democrat once in office.\\n\\nGail: Well, you have hope.\", \"text\": \"Gail Collins: Bret, we’ve spent a long time agreeing about stuff, thanks to our shared loathing of Donald Trump.
